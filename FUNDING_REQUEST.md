# Requesting funding for Servo-related activities

All use of Servo project funds must be approved by the [Servo TSC](governance/tsc/README.md).

To make a funding request, create a [new issue on this repository using the *Funding Request* template](https://github.com/servo/project/issues/new?template=funding-request.yaml). Then open a Zulip discussion in the [#tsc channel](https://servo.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/500774-tsc/) that contains whatever context is necessary to evaluate the request pointing to the issue.

Requests for funding fall into two categories:
1. Shared resources
2. Reimbursement for time/resources

When deciding whether to approve a given request, the Servo TSC weighs the proposed benefit to the project against the projected cost and long term maintenance/risk considerations.

## Funding requests for shared resources

This category covers funding for any equipment/service/process that could be used by multiple contributors to the Servo project.
Examples of appropriate funding requests include:

* adding new self-hosted CI runners
* cloud computing resources for running fuzzers
* subscription to a multi-seat SaaS product

## Funding requests for reimbursement

This category covers funding that goes directly to a project contributor.
Examples of appropriate funding requests include:

* travelling to give a conference talk
* purchasing development hardware
* grant for implementing a specific feature
* paid work on recurring project activities

## Funding timelines

Recurring funding requests will have the following conditions:
* Trial period (3 months): After 3 months, the people behind the funding request should do a brief report on the highlights during the initial 3 months. The TSC would decide if we continue or stop the funding request.
* Re-evaluation (after 12 months): All funding requests expire after 1 year. They can be renewed by requesting a continuation and getting approval by the TSC.

## Funding cancellation

If the financial situation of the Servo project changes significantly, the TSC might decide to stop any of the ongoing funding requests.

## Funding logistics

All approved funding requests will be paid through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/servo), which provides an [FAQ](https://docs.opencollective.com/oceurope/how-it-works/expenses/expenses-and-getting-paid-faqs).

To receive the funds, you will need to have a PayPal account or the ability to receive a bank transfer.

While legal identifying information may be required, this information will only be visible to Open Collective project admins.
