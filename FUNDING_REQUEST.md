# Requesting funding for Servo-related activities

All use of Servo project funds must be approved by the [Servo TSC](governance/tsc/README.md).
To make a funding request, create a new Zulip topic in the [#tsc channel](https://servo.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/500774-tsc/)
that contains whatever context is necessary to evaluate the request.

Requests for funding fall into two categories:
1. Shared resources
2. Reimbursement for time/resources

When deciding whether to approve a given request, the Servo TSC weighs the proposed benefit to the project against the projected cost and long term maintenance/risk considerations.

## Funding requests for shared resources

This category covers funding for any equipment/service/process that could be used by multiple contributors to the Servo project.
Examples of appropriate funding requests include:

* adding new self-hosted CI runners
* cloud computing resources for running fuzzers
* subscription to a multi-seat SaaS product

Requests should include answers to the following questions:

* What is the expected cost?
* Is this cost a one time payment or recurring?
* What is the expected benefit to the Servo project?
* Which active project members are expected to benefit from this resource?
* What alternatives were considered?
* Who will administer this resource, if applicable?

## Funding requests for reimbursement

This category covers funding that goes directly to a project contributor.
Examples of appropriate funding requests include:

* travelling to give a conference talk
* purchasing development hardware
* grant for implementing a specific feature
* paid work on recurring project activities

Requests should include answers to the following questions:

* What is the expected cost?
* Is this cost a one time payment or recurring?
* What is the expected benefit to the Servo project?
* What are the risks if this request isn't funded?
* Why you? What skills or experience make you a good candidate for this request?
