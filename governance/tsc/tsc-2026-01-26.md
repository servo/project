### Status update

rego: Many things going on, lots of work in different areas: DevTools, IndexedDB, Web Crypto API, WebDriver, etc.

rego: Improve interactivity with form inputs

rego: Progress on the initial a11y support

rego: Just released the blog post with all the updates of December: https://servo.org/blog/2026/01/23/december-in-servo/

### Platform support

jonathan: as we are getting more interest from other people (like that slint integration), they seem to have tested on arm windows and platforms we don't test on; also like android that we're not testing frequently; would it make sense for us to have a broader discussion about how our platform support looks like, like the Ruts compiler has tiers of support, should we do something similar here?

jonathan: recent dicussion for things like intel Mac, or windows 10 support, which can be on end of life; but maybe some people want to use

jonathan: do we want to do different levels for support? and then which platforms and who would be reponsible of these platforms? I could do it for OpenHarmony for example

nico: it's interesting to consider what the different levels of support can be; the top level would be we run all the WPT tests on CI, I think we only do that on Linux; and a level below, we need to build but we don't necessarily have to run the tests; if there are github runners available we could support things like intel mac until the github runners support finishes (I think it's September)

nico: maybe we have servo developers that we use intel mac, so it might be working for longer

nico: I'm not sure what's the situation with windows10, as rust is going to drop support soon

nico: other platforms that we don't support like iOS, and we might want to support

nico: not sure which platforms would end up in each tier

jonathan: make sense to me, it'd be only Linux alone, as it's the only one running WPT, but it's the most honest

nico: I've run WPT tests on macOS, there are some tests that have a few different results, probably just a few, like 20-30, not a huge number

jonathan: we also have small differences, running WPT tests locally vs CI, so we're probably similar to MacOS

nico: my experience with Rust, is that there are more often build failures than test failures cross-platforms

rego: identify the platforms we support better sounds like a good idea, and have them documented; for people that want to support something new like windows10, what we would request from them?

jonathan: maybe someone we can ping, for windows10 might be simpler, but for other like iOS or redux or something; someone we can ping and solve issues on those platforms and don't block us from merging PRs

nico: we could have a 3rd tier, when we run CI, but we don't make it blocking

rego: so we could have tier 1 for WPT (linux only so far), tier 2 (things we're working on), for tier 3 running in CI is madatory

jonathan: maybe CI is not needed, but something we can build for the platform

nico: maybe we can have tiers up one level, so we have the usual platforms in tier 1

rego: we usually say that we support 5 platforms: win, linux, mac, android, open harmony; but android has been getting less attention compared to the others

jonathan: maybe we should have active maintainers for the different platforms, maybe in some platforms we need more platform experience development (like android apps), than web engine development experience; maybe we can pool people into the project from different backgrounds

nico: I hope mobile support in rust in general is going to be better in a few years

rego: we haven't talked about the security aspect mentioned by jonathan on the issue, what happens for things that are end of life

joanthan: assuming chrome/safari/firefox drop support before us, and people switch to us as it's a supported platform, we probably want to avoid that from the security perspective

jonathan: I'd try to consider we add some kind of warning on platforms that are EOL, to point it's not secure to use them

nico: I'm not too worried about other browsers dropping this kind of platforms

nico: link from mozilla: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-support-windows-10-end-support

nico: mentioning end of support for win10 will be years away

nico: for macOS intel, currently until the next macOS release, intel macs can run the latest version of macOS, but that won't happen later; though they would still run 26 and that would be getting security updates for a while

nico: I agree we should be careful of being the only supported browser, but we're not in any danger like that currently.

rego: jonathan you can move the discussion on zulip, about the tiers and requirements to add a new platform

### Requirements for a 0.1 release (and when to bump to 0.2, 0.3, etc.)

rego: We have been doing monthly releases using 0.0.1, 0.0.2, etc. It'd be nice to discuss when to do the first 0.1 release. At Igalia we have been thinking about it, we would like to complete the ongoing work with the WebView API, to have it in a state that we can consider it a good initial version; we hope that would be ready in February. And do a blog post explaining what 0.1 means, that we have tested our release process and is working, but nothing else regarding expectations of features.

nico: I think that we ought to care about releasing, and not about API stability, cssparser and selectors have breaking changes in every single release and nobody has complained

nico: it'd be nice to do a stable API when we are ready, I don't see that as a requirement

nico: as we're publishing releases anyway, the main benefit of going to 0.1 is that we would be able to push patch releases

rego: I didn't meant anything about API stability, but more that we're close to complete the initial webview API work we had in mind, and it'd be nice to say 0.1 has the initial webview API shape (of course not promising stability at all)

jonathan: do you have an estimation on when this would be ready?

rego: we expect that by the end of February should be done

rego: and when we'll jump to 0.2, 0.3, etc. ?

jonathan: my suggestion is that we run cargo semver-checks and if we have breaking changes we move to 0.2, or 0.3

nico: I feel that might be not sufficient, even if it covers the Rust API, it doesn't cover the web API

nico: in theory we only add new features and it's backwards compatible, but not 100% it's true in practice, there are things like feature detecting, if people were pining the version of servo, they won't expect feature updates on a patched version, and would expect they're just patching fixes

jonathan: that has the downside that we'll always bump the version, patch releases are security updates or critical issues only

nico: to my mind it seems a good thing if we always bump the version

nico: the chances of people having two versions is very small, as people will depend on servo or one thing that wraps servo

rego: main browsers do major releases every 2 months or so, we're not talking about a major release, but maybe doing them on a time period like every month makes people understand better why we get a new version and not expect anything special

### [Funding request for architectural review work](https://github.com/servo/project/issues/206)

rego: this is the request from Gregory, who is not here today, maybe we can skip and discuss on zulip unless anyone has any thoughts

### [Time limit for funding requests](https://servo.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/500774-tsc/topic/Time.20limit.20for.20funding.20requests/with/569316917)

rego: this is about limiting to 1 year the funding requests, so people will have to request a continuation. Everyone was fine on zulip, so we can do a PR and get it reviewed

### Outreach

rego: in FOSDEM we have 2 Servo talks: by Taym and myself

rego: jonathan, delan, martin, eri are also attending

### AOB

rego: if no more topics, we can finish here

#### Next meeting

euclid: when is the next call?

rego: they happen monthly, last Monday of the month, next is 23 February, at 11:00 CET; we're alternating times from 17:00 CET to 11:00 CET each different month

rego: so this is over, thanks everyone
