## Agenda

* Approve 2021-10 meeting minutes

* TSC elections

* Any Other Business

## Notes

attending: simonsapin, jdm, ajeffrey, mrobinson

ajeffrey: board consists of TSC chair, Mozilla, and futurewei. LF has concept of “technical projects” which have governance and TSC but no member companies forming a board. Have reserves that can keep paying for CI for foreseeable future.

ajeffrey: opinions on Servo becoming a technical project?

jdm: in favor.

simonsapin: agreed. Don’t see finding more board members has having good traction right now.

ajeffrey: next order of business. Electing a new TSC chair for next year. Required to meet once per year.

jdm: I can be the chair.

ajeffrey: nominated!

mrobinson: Seconded.

all: motion passes!

jdm: fun fact! Someone’s making interesting PRs to servo, adding non-blocking network I/O and fixing some layout and script stuff.
